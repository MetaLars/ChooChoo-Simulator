# VR Steam Train Conductor Simulation (Unity, C#)

This project is a **VR-based simulation game** that recreates the experience of working as a **conductor on a steam train**.  
The simulation focuses on realistic interaction, environment awareness, and task-based gameplay within a virtual train cockpit.

The project was developed as a **group project**, with each team member contributing to different aspects of the simulation.

---

## Simulation Overview

The player takes the role of a train conductor and interacts with the controls and environment of a steam train while it is in motion.  
The goal is to respond to operational situations and maintain smooth and safe operation throughout the simulation.

## Implemented Systems

- Task-based interaction logic for conductor responsibilities
- VR input handling and interaction scripts
- Simulation state management
- Event-driven gameplay flow
- Integration of interactive cockpit elements
